## Background
For reliable harvests, a hydroponicist is required to control light and irriga$on cycles while monitoring the quality of the water.  Certain devices exist that can do this, but come in several installments and are expensive.

## Description
The motivation of this project is to begin putting numbers to hydroponic grow results.  The device contains inputs for monitoring pH, ORP, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, air temperature, air humidity, and light intensity.  It also bears an LCD screen and three navigational buttons for ease of navigation.  Lastly, the apparatus contains two relayed 110VAC outlets and one relayed 12VDC plug to control a variety of hydroponic utilities.
