## Background
Tag tracking is another way of describing the method of extracting a six-dimensional configuration of a QR-code-like binary matrix.  It's intended for tracking objects in view of a simple webcam, augmented reality, and tracking.

## Description
My focus was to evaluate a number of ROS packages that all largely do the same thing: track binary matrices.  The study includes assessing criteria of tracking accuracy, precision, update frequency, and unique tags.
