## Background
Exoskeletons are finding there way in several facets of life, ranging from assisting manufacturing floor workers in performing monotonous tasks, to augmenting military soldier's strength and endurance, to giving the paralyzed their own two legs on which to walk.  Consequentially from all of this, the cost for exoskeletons is still extravagantly high and with untapped potential.

## Description
Largely inspired from my work in prosthetic limbs at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the notion of amplifying the physical potential of a human being was very attractive to me.  My studies have taken place by moonlight, and focus on the mechanical, dynamic, and control aspects for a generic exoskeleton limb.  My motivation is to introduce exoskeletons to a public audience for strength rehabilitation, assistance, and cardiac output.  I've developed a prototype model and presently defining the scope of the project for the future.
