## Background
The quality and rate at which vegetation occurs in a ponic farm strongly correlates to the degree in which environmental variables are controlled.

## Description
The motivation of this project is to develop a controlled platform while conducting horticulture experiments.  Identified as Project Autonomous Control Environment, or ACE, this unit bears the capability to fully automate the farming process without any user input.  It is retrofitted from a functioning Craigslist upright freezer and equipped with a number of environmental control systems to ensure consistent and reliable grow data throughout the obseration process.  Further included are novel sensory designs to better quantify the outcome of experimentation.

This illustration marks the transition in which our startup has made - specifically in the field of research and development.  In learning about our team's core compentencies, we've realized our strengths in precision engineering and intend to explore this capability in a niche setting.
