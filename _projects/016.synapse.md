## Background
A number of home consumer hydroponic units are being introduced to the public in the interest of promoting sustainable thinking and healthy eating.  Consequentially, many of these units yield too little produce for their capital cost, and are difficult to use for those new to hydroponics.

## Description
As a second place winner in the University of Michigan Clean Energy Venture Challenge, this product attempts to illustrate the advantages to precision vertical farming at home.  The design a 'core model' in which a fish aquarium and vertical growing faces symbiotically develop, the ultimate output being a 60% higher yield per square foot as opposed to models of equivilent size.  Additionally, an upgradable 'brain' can be added to the system to connect basic sensory information to the user via bluetooth.  The motivation of the project was to create an aesthetic never before experienced in home gardening, and introduce a new way of thinking to younger generations.
